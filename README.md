# Angular-Sample-Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

## Prerequisites
A best practice is to run your project locally before you deploy it. To run your project locally, you need the following installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
- The [Angular CLI.](https://cli.angular.io/) From the terminal, install the Angular CLI globally with:

    ```
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

    With the Angular CLI, you can use the command ```ng``` to create new workspaces, new projects, serve your application during development, or produce builds to share or distribute.

## Install
To download and install npm packages, use the following npm CLI command:

```
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If the default port 4200 is not available, you can specify another port with the port flag as in the following example:

```
ng serve --port 4201
```

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
